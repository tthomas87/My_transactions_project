# Financial Transactions Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on the analysis of financial transaction data in order to identify spending patterns, trends, and anomalies.  
The goal is to demonstrate practical **Data Analyst skills**, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and result interpretation with business-oriented insights.

**Key focus areas:**
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering on transactional data
- Statistical insights and visualizations
- Clear interpretation of results for decision-making

---

##Dataset
The dataset contains anonymized financial transaction records.

**Typical features include:**
- Transaction date
- Transaction amount
- Transaction category
- Additional identifiers (e.g. transaction type)

The data is processed and cleaned to ensure consistency and usability for analysis.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

---

## Analysis Workflow
1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**
   - Handling missing values
   - Data type conversions
   - Basic validation checks

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Distribution of transaction amounts
   - Transaction frequency over time
   - Category-based spending patterns

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Time-based features (month, weekday)
   - Aggregations and grouped statistics

4. **Statistical Analysis**
   - Summary statistics
   - Detection of outliers and anomalies

5. **Visualization & Interpretation**
   - Clear plots to support analytical findings
   - Interpretation of results with a business perspective

---

## Key Insights
- Identification of dominant spending categories
- Detection of seasonal or time-based transaction patterns
- Recognition of abnormal or outlier transactions
- Actionable insights that could support financial monitoring or reporting

---

## Visualizations
The project includes visualizations such as:
- Transaction volume over time
- Distribution of transaction amounts
- Category-wise spending comparisons

These plots help translate raw data into understandable insights.
